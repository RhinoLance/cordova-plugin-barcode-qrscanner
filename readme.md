Original plugin/repo is `https://github.com/bitpay/cordova-plugin-qrscanner`. It was not working with the latest Android/iOS version. _It failed during XCode build._

Other packages on npm with apparent solutions kept installing the original plugin. _So they fail during XCode build, too._

**This is a fork of https://github.com/gianluigitrontini/cordova-plugin-qrscanner-nbs. That fork was forked from https://github.com/v1934/cordova-plugin-qrscanner-11, with a commit taken from https://github.com/NoahSun/cordova-plugin-qrscanner.**

**This plugin is working with the latest android and ios platform and contains fixes for compilation errors due to incompatibilities with Swift 5 and Android API level 32**

If you're using Ionic, switch to Capacitor.
